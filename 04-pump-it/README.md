# Pump-It - Tier 2
You notice the growing attention around pump.fun and can't help but take a deeper look. You are interested in their revenue sources and observe that they take fees for a few distinct actions.


- a) How much revenue did Pump generate and can you decompose this for each action? E.g. [pump.fun](http://Pump.Fun) takes fees for each trade on the bonding curve, so one revenue component would be the sum of all “trades via the bonding curve” (the distinct action).
- b) What percentage of tokens were successfully deployed to Raydium? Find the tokens that:
    - Took the most time to deploy to Raydium.
    - Took the least amount of time to deploy to Raydium.
- c) Using the information gained from the above sub-questions about fee generation, were there any cases where the pump team had a clear incentive to buy any given token created through their platform? If yes, provide an example. If no, explain the conditions under which this incentive would exist.
