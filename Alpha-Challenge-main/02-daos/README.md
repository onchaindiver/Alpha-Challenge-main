# DAOs - Tier 1
You’re a DeFi enthusiast who spends a lot of time participating in and analyzing DAOs, their governance contracts, and their overall level of participation. Over the past couple of years, the market has slowed down and you’ve begun to notice that some DAOs are not the same as they used to be.


- a) Identify a set of DAOs that are most vulnerable to an economic governance attack, describe how it may be achieved, and estimate the cost to the attacker.
- b) For vulnerable DAOs, estimate and describe the potential benefit for the attacker i.e., how much of the DAO’s treasury is at risk of being stolen? (it can also be a parameter change)
