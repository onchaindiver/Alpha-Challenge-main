The Alpha Challenge is our experimental way to reach two goals:
- to provide a way for the crypto community to test their on-chain analysis skills
- to find the best talents for roles requiring a researcher mindset at Wintermute and portfolio/friendly companies

## Rules

### How to start
1. Complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepRplKQcGdeQOuvzqON8MW8QLs8M2_a7oLwWba1iiZKqWaSA/viewform) to give us a way to reach out to winners of this challenge
2. [Import this repository](https://github.com/new/import) as a private one
3. Add `frankresearcher` and `zakriaabdi` as [collaborators to this private repo](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository)
4. Start solving
5. Request access to the Telegram group by using the badge at the beginning of the README

### How to solve
Each solution should be placed in its corresponding directory as a text file, including both the answers and their rationale. Additionally, include any code files that are part of the solution. It's probably better to be more verbose than brief in how results were achieved in order to analyze possible mistakes later or give a more accurate score.

For any questions asking for code where the programming language has not been specified, participants are free to use any programming language (including SQL) and any platform (e.g. sim or Dune). We recommend making use of the Foundry toolkit where possible.

### Scoring
As a general guideline, Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 questions are worth 5, 10, and 15 points respectively. The sub-questions are designed such that `c` > `b` > `a` in terms of difficulty and score. Achieving 60 points in total can be considered as a successful participation, and we will reach out to the best.

### Deadline
We will review the state of the `main` branch of private repos based on the last commit at 11:59 PM UTC on September 4, 2024. Any commits after the deadline date will be ignored.

### How to be qualified as a winner
To qualify as a winner, participants need to score at least 60 points based on their work in a private repo by the deadline and rank in the Top 25 by points. We will reach out to the Top 25 via email, so make sure the application form is filled out before the deadline.

Please avoid posting any solutions in the Telegram group or elsewhere until the challenge ends, as this could lead to disqualification from any awards and ensures the integrity of the competition. It's also important to not push anything to a public repo until the deadline, as this could result in disqualification.

We ask all participants to double-check that all collaborators have been added before the deadline. In some cases, after changing the repo name collaborators can lose access, therefore they will not be able to review solutions. It is the participant's responsibility to ensure that review is possible.

### Support
We add all participants who filled out our form to a Telegram group, where we will post organizational updates, and participants can ask questions if any tasks are unclear. Participants can also leave requests to join the group using the Telegram badge at the start of this README; everyone who has already filled out the application form will be added shortly.

### Try sim for this challenge
sim Studio enables fast indexing and instrumentation of transactions.
It lets you hook on calls, logs, storage operations, and more while enabling you to run Solidity code in the context of the hooked event.
See a full JIT LPing example written in sim Studio [here](https://studio.sim.io/tal/canvases/06216600-4ba4-4b7f-be7d-6fce27d6482c).

Fill out [their form](https://go.smlxl.io/wintermutechallenge) to remove account restrictions for one month from the start of the challenge.
